  "description": "The Rasch model (Rasch 1960) is an item response theory model for dichotomous items. The two-parameter logistic model (2PL) (Swaminathan and Gifford 1985) is an item response theory model that includes parameters for both the difficulty and discrimination of dichotomous items. The version presented includes a latent regression. However, the latent regression part of the model may be restricted to an intercept only, resulting in a regular 2PL.",
