  "description": "The model is essentially a random effects logistic,\n          allowing for over-dispersion. Models the proportion of germination\n          of different seeds in different root extracts. 'Stanified' & centered:\n          tau replaced by sigma, direct estimation using \n          narrower semi-informative priors, coefficients are centered",
